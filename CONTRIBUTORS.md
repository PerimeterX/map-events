## Technical
In addition to this project there is a [website](https://perimeterx.github.io/map-events-website/) that should show the events map of every (os + browser) combination that ever existed.

In reality however, it shows most of the existing combinations, but not all of them.

The original maps were extracted using every existing combination in [browserstack](https://browserstack.com), and some more updates were added from manual testing on relatively new browser versions about a year later, but even in browserstack many automatic combinations have failed + there are missing versions in between the two runs + for future versions not yet maintained.

Also, the working extraction script is not automatic and does not run every time there's a new Browser/OS.

Contributing to the [JSON](https://github.com/perimeterx/map-events-website/blob/master/data.json) could help a lot with maintaining the map and keeping it as updated and as accurate as possible.
